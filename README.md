# I made some dotfiles

I sorta started on my own thread and then decided that it would be more maintainable and keep me more sane if I followed some sort of rhyme or reason to why I was doing things. So I pretty much lifted what I needed from Holman's dotfiles (https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and added / removed what I needed to.

Hopefully it works.

## Install

```
git close https://github.com/durfee/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
